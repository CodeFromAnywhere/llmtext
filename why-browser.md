Why do I _realy_ need a browser

- stay up to date on hackernews, twitter feed, email
- watch videos on youtube
- read news on other random websites
- have meetings on zoom, meet, etc
- slack and other communication
- search using google, groq, chatgpt, claude, perplexity
- test (and maybe later build) my own websites

Of all these things, we currently can't control much of the experience except with custom plugins on chrome and safari. however that would be a giant undertaking and has lots of friction to be installed. But wait... there's another way!

What if I had a clonesite for every site? What if I made them actually usable and interlink to each other? What if that info is all tracked and sent to the user for local storage and processing?

This could be a true game-changer because:

- it's super low-friction to get in
  - just change your search engine
  - maybe 1 plugin to always redirect certain domains
  - just go to the domain directly or
  - just find it on google
  - no installation in propriatary browsers required
- it allows lots of control to the individual
  - what is tracked and what isn't
  - where does data go and how is it processed
  - how can the website be made more helpful
  - anything you can do with plugins
- its good for privacy as it makes the individual untracked as it's basically a proxy

If I get far enough with github deployment and the framework of english, this is a great strategy to start with. Ultimately all these things can be going through API or browser automation so all of them can have a masksite
