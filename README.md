# LLM Text - Perfect Context for any URL

Convention:

- https://llmtext.com/{url}
- Regular cURL will always respond with something fitting in the LLM Context
- Browser request will always respond with HTML containing the main thing but has a navigation bar for further exploration of the possibilities
- The simplest cURL response will always work with small LLMs and thus should fit in under 10k LLM tokens.

TODO:

- ✅ integrate with npmjz, uithub, and youtudo
- ✅ for all else, use r.jina.ai with api key
- pass accept header properly
- make google -> serper
-
