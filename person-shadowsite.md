I guess it's almost always a good idea to build shadowsites. What if these would all link to a platform that would connect all socials for a person? If we do it and allow open access to this data, we'd have something very interesting.

- x.com/{username} -> llmtext.com/x.com/{username}
- facebook.com/{username} -> llmtext.com/facebook.com/{username}
- linkedin.com/in/{username} -> llmtext.com/linkedin.com/in/{username}
- instagram.com/{username} -> llmtext.com/instagram.com/{username}
- github.com/{username} -> llmtext.com/github.com/{username}

This convention is useful to immediately look up more info about any person. The url is just the identifier and a single human has multiple of those. In the back, each of these goes to the same page about the human in general. The key valueprop could be that this tracks the human across the internet rather than just one network. Think about wikipedia, spotify, mastodon, reddit, personal blogs, podcasts, news, and much more.

If I start with famous people and influencers -and have a way for them to optout before scraping- this could be huge.

Making all this data openly available is crushing the friction that we've had for decades.
